# My First Coding Project

Welcome to my first coding project! I am just starting my journey in learning how to code. This repository will document my progress and learning experience.

## About
This is where I'll be experimenting with code and building my programming skills. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to learn and grow!

## Favorite Programming Language
JavaScript is my favorite programming language! I love its versatility and how it can be used for both front-end and back-end development.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
